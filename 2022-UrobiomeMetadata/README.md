Introduction to Urobiome Metadata Standards

Brief Description:  Metadata (“data about data”) contain essential information that provide context for understanding experimental data, and is critical for data reuse. Lisa Karstens, PhD will provide an introduction of data that ideally should be collected and shared alongside sequencing data generated for investigating microbial communities, with a focus on the  urobiome (microbial communities in the bladder and lower urinary tract). She will review existing resources, including those developed by the National Microbiome Data Collaborative (NMDC), and progress made towards adapting existing metadata standards for the urobiome research community.
